## MongoDB and MongoDB Express

To develop while running these services from the `compose.yml` file, you can run the commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Start MongoDB and MongoDB Express
docker-compose up -d mongo mongo-express
```

This will create and start the necessary containers for MongoDB and MongoDB Express, but will not build and start the application container.

```bash
# To stop the containers
docker-compose down
```
